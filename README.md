## Managed Kubernetes vs self-managed Kubernetes

### What does it mean to have "managed Kubernetes"?

Despite the fact that Kubernetes is free source, many firms who want to use it don't have the skills or resources to set up and manage the cluster. Managed Kubernetes providers assist those interested in using Kubernetes by providing the necessary support and management for Kubernetes clusters. A managed Kubernetes deployment should offer users a painless control plane, simple deployment options, and ongoing Kubernetes maintenance, allowing them to focus on their company and getting their apps to market.

Many cloud providers offer managed Kubernetes services, however the configuration options and degree of support they provide to their customers vary slightly.


### Comparisson 
- The provider-managed Kubernetes service reduces the time and effort required to administer and maintain a cluster by taking care of the master node.

- You have more control over your cluster using self-managed Kubernetes. You can use various cloud computing services and even you can use your own on-site infrastructure.
